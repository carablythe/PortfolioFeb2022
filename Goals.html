          <p>Hi! I'm Cara. I've taught ESL/EFL in various contexts for quite some time, mainly in Japan, but also in the U.S. when I was in graduate school, and in Kiribati and Namibia through the Peace Corps and the World Teach Program, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>I love math, puzzles, languages, architecture, painting, music, and cooking and eating food of any country (the spicier the better!). It’s been a lifelong goal to incorporate as many of my interests as possible into my work, and I think I’ve made a solid effort thus far!  But there are still a lot out of possibilities out there to explore.
          </p>
          <p>Why the shift to tech? I have enjoyed a long career as a language teacher, and as a result, working with so many individuals that have changed me for the better.  However, the past couple of years I have felt fossilized in my learning/research/job options in the field of English language teaching, so I decided to try a completely different craft. I like problem-solving and focusing on a product, which satisfies my need to create, whereas teaching has primarily meant interacting with others and not really making anything tangible.  And learning new technologies is just really fun!
