          <p>
            I have been teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) in various
            contexts for a number of years now, though mainly in Japan and mainly
            at the university level. The past couple of years, however,  I have
            felt fossilized in my work, that perhaps I have reached my full
            potential in the field of English language teaching. Therefore, I
            decided to shift to a more technical field where I can have the
            opportunity to pursue my interests, satisfy my need to create things
            and simply learn more.
            <br/>
            The part of teaching I have always loved is actually such a small
            fraction of what my work has entailed: designing syllabuses,
            curricula, lesson materials, tests, assignments, etc.  I have also
            proudly operated 100% paperless classrooms since 2017, during which
            time I have created multitudinous hybrid and online courses and run
            them using learning management systems and supplementary learning
            apps. I also enjoy coding, math, puzzles, languages, architecture, oil
            painting and really any kind of creative outlet or problem-solving
            activity!
            <br/>
            If there is anyone who has a role I would be a good fit for, please
            kindly contact me!  Thank you! </p>
