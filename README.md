SEI project portfolio February 2022

OVERALL APPROACH TAKEN:
I tried to make a somewhat professional-looking homepage to showcase my skills as an up-and-coming software engineer/

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
I used CSS and HTML mainly and some jQuery and Javascript for some button, text appearance and image carousel effects.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:

Also, although I spent many hours playing with various color palettes, layouts, images, etc., I am not satisfied with the general appearance at all. It looks too simple, so I would like to update the design and layout in the future.

While I eventually figured out how to do dropdown menus using CSS, I first tried to learn various ways of making them via javascript and jQuery, at which I did not succeed, but would someday soon like to learn how to do. (I left my *work-that-didn't-work* commented out at the bottom of my app.js file for your reference).

FINAL COMMENT:
I hope to continue to embellish and expand on this project (and also make it more professional looking and aesthetically pleasing) in coming months because I think it is a good way to advertise myself to potential employers.
