SEI project portfolio February 2022

INTRO:
This was a great idea, and I wish I could do more with it before presentation day, but this project unfortunately coincided with the week all 10 of my college courses's grades were due, so it is really just meeting the minimum requirements at this point.  I hope to continue to embellish and expand on this project (and also make it more professional looking and aesthetically pleasing) in coming months because I think it is a good way to advertise myself to potential employers.
