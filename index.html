            Why the shift to tech? I have enjoyed a long career as a language teacher, and as a result, working with so many individuals that have changed me for the better.  However, the past couple of years I have felt fossilized in my learning/research/job options in the field of English language teaching, so I decided to take a leap and try a completely different craft. I like coding because I can focus on a product, which satisfies my need to create, whereas teaching has primarily meant interacting with others and not really making anything tangible.  The problem-solving aspect of software development is a fun challenge, as well, and learning new technologies is just really fun!
