            <h3>I have taught English as a foreign language (EFL) in various contexts, primarily in Japan and mostly at the university level. However, the past few years I have felt like I reached my full potential in the field of language education. Therefore, I decided to transition to a career where there is more opportunity to not only satisfy my need to create things, but to improve and make use of my skills in a broader context.</h3>
            <h3>
              The part of teaching I have always enjoyed is designing syllabi, curricula, lesson materials, tests, assignments, etc. Since 2017, I have been creating 100% e-learning experiences. I ran these blended, hybrid, and online courses using learning management systems and supplementary learning apps. Nonetheless, designing these courses and materials was such a small fraction of what my work entailed, and being so limited in the time I could spend on these activities, it felt like wasted potential.</h3>
            <h3>
            I also enjoy coding, math, puzzles, languages, architecture, <a href="artwork.html" class="artworkLink"><b>oil painting</b></a> and really any kind of creative outlet or problem-solving activity, all of which contribute to producing quality work.
